1. Write a method to compare two binary trees. [DONE]

2. You have a simple tree structure Ⓐ and its clone ⓐ. Given an original tree's node Ⓑ, find and return the cloned tree's node ⓑ that is the clone of node Ⓑ.
Each node in the tree has a pointer to it's parent as well as an array of it's children. [DONE]

3. K Cloest Points [DONE]

4. Return the head node of the singly linked list with each pair of nodes swapped. If there is a last odd node leave it in place. [DONE]
Example:
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5  

5. How to detect a common superview. [DONE]

6. Binary tree to list, inorder [DONE]

7. The same list, back to inorder binary tree [DONE]

8. Move Zeros [DONE]

9. Given nested arrays, write an enumerator class such that "next()" returns the elements in sequential order, e.g.:
[1,[4,3],6,[5,[1,0]]] -> 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 0
also implement "allObjects" for this class [DONE]

10. How would you copy a custom object like a "Node" from a search tree in Objective C? [DONE]

11. Given an array, remove the duplicates and return a unique array keeping the first occurrence of the duplicates and the order. [Done]
[@2, @1, @3, @1, @2] --> [@2, @1, @3]

12. Verify that a binary search tree is indeed a binary search tree. [DONE]

13. Convert a string into an integer without using the in-built frameworks. [DONE]

14. Given an array of strings, remove any duplicates and return a new array containing the first occurrence of each string. [DONE]

15. Read4 (希望以后面fb的诸位，千万小心入口buff需要变动位置，函数外创建类，类里头存上次buff读入的byte数，然后做移动。)
int Read(int Size, char * buffer) using int Read4(char * buffer) [DONE]

16. 二叉树的copy和中序遍历 [DONE]

17. Lowest Common Ancestor [DONE]

18. LUC [DONE]

19. 2Sum, 3Sum, 4Sum [DONE]

20. Remove duplicate from sorted array [DONE]

21. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal [DONE]

22. Remove Invalid Parentheses [DONE]

23. Valid BST Tree [DONE]

24. subarray sum ＝ k [DONE]

25. Moving Average from Data Stream (http://blog.csdn.net/jmspan/article/details/51289338)

26. strStr [DONE]

27. add binary

28. Valid Palindrom [DONE]

29. Add and Search word [DONE]

30. Sorting Colors II [DONE]

31. Previous (Next) permutation [DONE]

32. Paint House II

33. Verify Preorder Sequence [DONE]
