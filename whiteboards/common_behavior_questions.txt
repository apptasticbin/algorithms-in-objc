1 First, ask some questions about Facebook, do you use Facebook? 
Yes, I started using Facebook many years ago.

2 Why you like it?
I like using it, because it is a quick way to connect my friends. I can store my greatest memories in Facebook,
and I can share them to others by videos or beautiful group of pictures. Also the group is also a great feature
to keep in touch with my cloest friends, and even sell something with it. And the new camera and filters.

3 Which part of it should be improved?
Sometimes the news feed get mass-up with videos and native ads, and I can not find what I want.
Also the group feature needs improvement for selling stuffs. 

4 What challenge you face in your pre project and how you result it?
Technically the biggest challenge I ever had is the RCSe project in Nokia. I was young in software development,
and I was totally new in Windows Phone system. I quickly learned C# and Windows Phone development, and took the 
major UI development tasks for the whole project. Also I did a little system level implementation, like push notification service, but not so much.
The result for this project was pretty ok, because our team and I made it. But to be honest, many problem also existed in this project.

5 Why facebook
1) Facebook is my dream company, Tech-driven and data-driven. I'm feeling excited in what Facebook has done for connecting people, 
and also will do, such as VR / AR, etc. I want to contribute in Facebook.

2) Facebook has great engineering culture. I have heard a lot from my friend who is working in Facebook. People can choose their project or team,
and free to take responsibility. Also knowledge sharing in Facebook is great. Flat management, no much hierachy.

3) Facebook has great and talented people. I want to work with them.

4) I want to challenge myself, and Facebook is a great company worth me to challenge.

6 My current project and how I scale our applications.
Tori.fi is an E-Commerce service. We try to provide best experience for users to sell / buy second-hand items, like phone, shoes, or even cars.
When I joint this company, they only had mobile-site throughput on mobile devices. I joint this company, collaborate with global team,
developed local features and released both iOS and Android apps for our company. 

7 包括以前的成就，怎么说服别人做design的修改，说服不通怎么办.
A / B testing and data-driven can prove many things. I think it is better to test and discuss based on data, not just by argument.

8 FB specifically (vs. other companies).

Why Facebook?

1. why fb
2. most chanllenge work.
3. how to solve conflicts with workmates.
Use data to prove. Discuss and point out the problem softly and straightly. 

你觉得做project你最enjoy哪个部分，最tricky的是哪个部分，每个project大概做多久呀之类的
I enjoyed most parts, like UI development, structure design, performance improvement, and also data analysing.

The most tricky part I think is working with UI, because UI is always very fancy and customized. Also many API level bugs happen 
on UI. For example, margin issue, transparent issue, calculate layout, etc.

你遇到的最大挑战是什么；你最值得骄傲的成就是什么；你怎么解决和别人的冲突。
Technically RCSe is the biggest challenge. Tori is very challenging for cooperating and further development.
I'm very proud of my current work, because with my effort, I helped company to win in the mobile platform, and earned money from
the features I implemented, like native ads, and other features.

你什么最骄傲的项目做的是什么
The Pokemon Go Radar is the project I'm most proud of. No documentation, only by Reddit cracking team and some public projects
in GitHub. Used protobuf, and made it communicate with real game server and worked perfectly.

你有没有做项目逾期了怎么解决的
I tried to avoid this happen. If it happened and it was my fault, I will try to catch up the schedule.
If it is caused by something we can not control, I will carefully explain to manager what happened, and what's next step.

你的老板是怎么评价你的
Hard-working, responsible, has forward-looking

你和同事意见不一致你是怎么说服他的

如果面试官表示你的项目不够Challenging，你应该如何应对？
It happends maybe to everyone. Sometimes you found a great company, but they don't have much requirements and also their
work is not very challenge, this is normal. That's why as a developer, even work is not challenging, I still try to find 
challenge tasks myself for my hobby projects. And also this is why I want to join Facebook, because I also want challenging tasks 
from work.

This interview will be with a leadership engineer or technical team manager and will consist of a combination of two aspects: a conversation and coding. During the conversation the interviewer will pose questions about your technical background, career experience, what you’re looking for at Facebook, and why you may fit in better at Facebook vs. other companies. Ask questions! You should be getting to know us just as much we get to know you.

Some topics might include:

•Explain some of the work you've been doing in the past few years.

•What are you most passionate about? Talk about a project you've done whereyou were at your best.
I'm passionate about making great ideas into real projects. Just like PokeRadar.

•Explain a recent exceptionally difficult challenge. How did you overcome it? What did you learn?
Our app fully crashed on iOS 9 emulator, but not on device. Everyone couldn't find the reason, and no one want to dig into it.
So I took the responsibility and found that it was caused by my mistake. One method I implemented in a class category had the same
name as the new API for force touching. I learned that how important using the prefix for category methods.

•Why are you interested in Facebook? How do you foresee your impact here?
Facebook is great, and Facebook has unique way of implementing iOS app, like component-kit, ASDK, etc.
I will bring new ideas and my way of thinking to Facebook. Also my previous experience may help Facebook 
to improve its product, for example, the improving the selling feature of facebook group.

Facebook has great open culture. Great knowledge sharing. I will learn a lot and stimulate my potential, and contribute to this 
great company. 

*What's your weaknees?
Sometimes I check too much details and think too much design, and make me not very efficient at the beginning of the project. 
For some projects, it is better to first make a working solution, then improve it, but not do rocket science. But I'm tring to overcome 
this weaknees.

*Biggest Failure?
In Nokia, I was young and lacking of design experience. Our project has many design problem is the ending phase.
I designed many major parts of that project, and I made many mistakes.

*Questions for Facebook:
- For Matt: did you ask your team members to follow the coding style you mentioned in your book?
- How does iOS developers usually work in Facebook?
- How does the knowledge sharing work in Facebook internally?
- For Interviewer: could you share me about what you working on in Facebook.
- Does iOS developer use "Nuclide" for daily work?
- Is Reactive Native used in all Facebook projects?
- How does Facebook control the code quality? How to do code review in Facebook? How strict?
- How did you beceom an interviewer in Facebook?

### Resume Walk Through ###

1. Quick show of success
2. Key stories: what have you done in previous companies; just hint; let the interviewer ask for details
3. Hobbies: hobby projects, or technical hobbies; make them relevant to the job

Think about some projects to talk about.
Think about non-technical questions, like what were the biggest challenges, what where the architecture, etc.

Prepare to discuss at least 2-3 projects in detail
1. technical stuff
2. soft skills

Focus on what "you" did in the projects, not only "we or they".

Think about some weaknees and bad things; Don't hide the bad things you have done. To be honest and soft.

### How Companies Evaluate Technical Interviews ###

- Interviewer will think about "what do I think about you as a software engineer".
- Maybe you are not familiar with some APIs, and interviewer will think you are not using it everyday. But it doesn't mean "failure".
- Key is to "shout your thought out". Show what you are thinking. If got stuck, show what you are thinking. Give the interviewer the headline of your thought process.
- Try to give interviewer as much as you can.
